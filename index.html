    <div class="personal-statement">
       <p>I am an experience designer with a focus on service design. I am skilled at using qualitative and quantitative research methods to inform digital and physical design solutions. Throughout my UX process, I strive to understand the scope of the problem, the industry it is a part of and most importantly the user. I love telling a story in the form of user personas linked to use cases informed by user feedback. Blending both digital and physical experiences gets me really excited because I get to see the entire user journey come to life. In my next role I want to work with an in-house team that allows me to work across both user experience research and design.</p>
